## 3. Getting started  [<img src="images/productivDuck.png" style="float:right;width:30px;height:30px;" alt="duck">](#table-of-contents)

Ready to be productive? Follow the steps here to _get quacking with Productiv_:

1. Ensure you have **Java 11** installed in your computer (it should be your default Java version).

1. Download the latest **productiv.jar** file from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to an empty folder.

1. Double-click the file to launch Productiv. 

## 4. Features  [<img src="images/productivDuck.png" style="float:right;width:30px;height:30px;" alt="duck">](#table-of-contents)

Now that you have Productiv up and running, let's get familiarised with the features of Productiv.

To enhance your product management, here are the 4 modes that are available to you:
* **Dashboard**: Gives you an overview of your product’s development and upcoming events so that you can work better towards production deadlines.
* **Deliverable**: Helps you track your product’s deliverables so that you can aim better to meet them.
* **Meeting**: Helps you manage your product-related meetings so that you can be clearer about your meeting schedule.
* **Contact**: Helps you organise your developer or stakeholder contacts so that you can reference them easily.
   
Next, let's get acquainted with Productiv's application layout.
If you have launched Productiv, you should see a window similar to the figure below.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/UiLabel.png" alt="Ui Label">
<i>Figure 1: Layout of Productiv</i>
</p>
<br>

Here is the main list of Productiv's layout components and what you can do with them:
   * **Navigation bar**: Navigate to other modes. 
   * **Command box**: Enter your commands. 
   * **Feedback box**: View success or error messages based on your commands.
   * **Left panel**: View your product's overall completion percentage or a list of your deliverables/meetings/contacts (depending on your current mode)
   * **Right panel**: View your product management schedule or an expanded view of your selected deliverable/meeting/contact (depending on your current mode)

   <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">
   **:information_source: GUI components:**<br>
   For modes other than the dashboard, you can see the respective data file path at the bottom of the application. 
   </div>

All that's left now is to execute some simple commands in Productiv!
This can be done by typing in the command box and pressing the Enter key. 
Here is a sequence of example commands that you can try:

   1. `switch dv`: Switches to deliverable mode.
   
   1. `view 1`: Displays the 1st deliverable shown.
   
   1. `delete 1`: Deletes the 1st deliverable shown.

And it's as simple as that! But of course, there's more to just these three commands.

## 5. Commands  [<img src="images/productivDuck.png" style="float:right;width:30px;height:30px;" alt="duck">](#table-of-contents)

This section provides a list of all the available commands you can use to improve your productivity.
Do take your time to explore each one of them so that you can fully utilize the app.
Ultimately, _Productiv is designed to make product management more convenient and powerful for you_.

Now, let's first understand the common components found in a typical command:<br>

Component | Description |
---------------------|------------|
Command word | The first word of a command. It is the action that you want to perform. |
Prefix | The characters before the parameter. It is the short-form of the corresponding field. |
Parameter |	The words following each prefix. It represents the value of the corresponding field. |

For example, here's the breakdown of the command `add t/TITLE by/DEADLINE m/MILESTONE [c/CONTACTS] [d/DESCRIPTION]`:
* Command word - `add`
* Prefixes - `t/`, `by/`, `m/`, `c/`, `d/`
* Parameters - `TITLE`, `DEADLINE`, `MILESTONE`, `CONTACTS`, `DESCRIPTION`
