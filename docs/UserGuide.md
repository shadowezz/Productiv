## Introduction
### Overview
Productiv is a one-stop desktop app for product managers like yourself to organise your **deliverables**, 
**meetings** and **contacts** so that you can track your product's development easily.

Productiv is optimized for use via Command Line Interface (CLI). Thus, if you like to type and/or type fast, 
Productiv has just become better for you. Nevertheless, Productiv still has the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).


### Preview
To get you familiarised, the following is Productiv's GUI. 

   ![Ui](images/UiLabel.jpg)
   <figcaption>Dashboard</figcaption><br>
   
   <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
   
   **:information_source: GUI components:**<br>
   
   1. **Navigation bar**: where you navigate to other modes. <br>
   1. **Command box**: where you enter your commands. <br>
   1. **Feedback box**: where you can see the feedback of your command.
        If your command is successful, you can see a success message.
        Otherwise, you can see an error message. <br>
   1. **Left panel**: where you can view <br>
      * your product's overall completion percentage (in dashboard mode), or <br>   
      * your list of deliverables, meetings, or contacts (in deliverable, meeting, or contact mode) <br>
   1. **Right panel**: where you can view <br>
      * your product management schedule (in dashboard mode), or <br>
      * an expanded view of your selected deliverable, meeting, or contact (in deliverable, meeting, or contact mode) <br>
    
   Note: For modes other than the dashboard, you can see your file path at the bottom of your GUI.

Here is a sequence of example commands you can try:<br>

   1. `switch dv`: Switches to deliverable mode.

   1. `add t/Find profile page template by/11-12-2020 12:00 m/2.1.1`: Adds a deliverable with the

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in upper case are the parameters to be supplied by you for their respective fields.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter for the name field `n`, which can be used as `add n/Jason`.<br>
:bulb: **Tip:** If you are not sure what specific parameter to supply for any of the required fields, supply an estimate or random value as place holder.<br>

* Field-parameter pairs in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [p/PHONE]` can be used as `n/Jason p/98890112` or as `n/Jason`.

* Field-parameter pairs can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME e/EMAIL`, `e/EMAIL n/NAME` is also acceptable.
  
* If multiple and/or repeat parameters are provided for the same field, only the last parameter will be accepted.<br>
  e.g. if you input the command `add r/dev n/NAME r/stk e/EMAIL r/stk`, it will be accepted as `add n/NAME r/stk e/EMAIL`.

* For single-word commands without fields, any word(s) following it will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if you input the command `list everything please`, it will be accepted as `list`.
